# Virtual Try On & 3D Fitting room

### Try on for accessories and apparels: 
The technology aims to bridge the gap between physical and virtual shopping by enhancinng the user’s shopping experience. It aims to provide a sustainable, safe and secure digital infrastructure in view of the pandemic.


## Built on: 

### Try on for accessories: 
The tech was built using pose net model, tensor flow, and image processing algorithms. 
Self devised algorithm was made to fit the target on the person.

### Try on for apparels: 
The prototype was build using :
1) Unity
2) C#
3) Blender


## Starting the model on the machine: 

### Try on for accessories: 
1) Install the dependency from requirements.txt.      
2) The following versions are must Python =3.6.5.    
3) Tensorflow 1.15.0                            
4) Run the code by navigating to target folder and typing python jewelcode.py

### Try on for apparels:
1) Install Unity 2017.3.0f3
2) Download all files
3) Go to game mode and click Play button.
